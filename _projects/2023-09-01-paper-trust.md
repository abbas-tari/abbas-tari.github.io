## Abstract
**This is still work in progress, so over time I try to complete the post here.**

Here, we begin by exploring the rationality of ethical trust as a foundational concept. This exploration involves distinguishing between trust and trustworthiness and delving into scenarios where trust is both rational and moral. It lays the groundwork for understanding the complexities of trust dynamics in high-stakes decision-making scenarios.
Following this theoretical groundwork, we introduce an agent-based simulation framework that investigates these dynamics of ethical trust, specifically in the context of disaster response scenarios. This framework is designed to simulate the behavior of autonomous agents representing various humanitarian organizations. These agents, utilizing advanced emotional models like Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions and memory learning mechanisms, are tasked with allocating limited resources in disaster-affected areas. Their decision-making is influenced by a myriad of factors, including unique priorities, perceptions of urgency, and diverse approaches to disaster management.
The model, which embodies the principles discussed in the first section, integrates cognitive load management, Big Five personality traits, and structured interactions within networked or hierarchical settings. It also includes feedback loops and simulates external events to evaluate their impact on the formation and evolution of trust among agents. Through our simulations, we demonstrate the intricate interplay of cognitive, emotional, and social factors in ethical decision-making. These insights shed light on the behaviors and resilience of trust networks in crisis situations, emphasizing the role of rational and moral considerations in the development of trust among autonomous agents.
This study contributes to the field by offering a comprehensive understanding of trust dynamics in socio-technical systems and by providing a robust, adaptable framework capable of addressing ethical dilemmas in disaster response and beyond.

## Introduction
### Exploring Trust and Trustworthiness
Max Otto's insights on trust set the stage for our exploration into the nuances of trust and trustworthiness, crucial in shaping our worldview and understanding of humanity. We examine the moral obligations surrounding trustworthiness and the discerning nature of trust, delving into the philosophical literature that distinguishes these concepts. This exploration provides a deep understanding of the moral imperatives associated with trustworthiness and the situational, context-dependent nature of trust.

### Understanding Trust Limits and Rationality
Further, we explore 'Trust Limits,' emphasizing the multi-dimensional nature of trust, which includes self-trust and trust in external entities. We discuss the necessity of discernment in trusting, considering the benefits and drawbacks in different relationships. The section concludes with an analysis of 'Trust Rationality,' exploring scenarios where trust aligns with rational and moral principles, drawing insights from various philosophical perspectives.

### Transition to Computational Modeling
We then transition to computational modeling, acknowledging the interplay of moral, psychological, and rational aspects in human relationships. Here, we highlight the importance of computational models in understanding these dynamics, discussing recent advancements in the field and their contributions to policy formulation and technology design. This section sets the stage for our own contribution: an Agent-based Cognitive Computational Model.

### Agent-based Cognitive Computational Model
Our contribution lies in the development of an Agent-based Cognitive Computational Model, designed to simulate ethical trust in collective decision-making. This model features Emotional Agents with advanced emotional models, memory, and learning capabilities, reflecting human cognitive processes in trust and ethics. We discuss how our model captures the dynamic nature of trust development and offers valuable insights for research in various fields.
