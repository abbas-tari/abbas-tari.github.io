## Description
**This is still work in progress, so over time I try to complete the post here.**

Here, we talk about an agent-based modeling
framework for simulating the dynamics of ethical trust within a
population of agents. Our model incorporates time-variant dynamic attributes, such as rationality, trustworthiness, reliability,
and reputation, to capture the complexities of trust evolution.
We explore the impact of various interaction rules and agent
cluster configurations on the trust dynamics, while accounting
for external disturbances and noise. Through various simulations,
we provide insights into the emergent behaviors and resilience
of trust networks under different scenarios, contributing to a
deeper understanding of ethical trust formation and maintenance
in multi-agent systems. This approach has potential applications
in designing robust, trustworthy, and adaptive sociotechnical
systems.

Trust is a complex and multidimensional concept that involves moral, social, psychological, and rational aspects. It is essential for human cooperation and well-being, but it can also be vulnerable to betrayal, deception, and manipulation.
Ethical theories of trust can be divided into two main categories: deontological and consequentialist. Deontological theories focus on the duties and obligations of the trustor and the trustee, while consequentialist theories evaluate the outcomes and consequences of trusting or being trusted.
Mathematical modelling is a useful tool for studying trust, as it can capture the dynamics and feedback loops of trust-related phenomena, such as cooperation, reputation, reciprocity, risk, uncertainty, and learning. Mathematical models can also test different scenarios and policies that may affect trust levels and outcomes.
Two common types of mathematical models for trust are system dynamics models (SDM) and agent-based models (ABM). SDM are top-down models that represent the aggregate behaviour of a system using differential equations, while ABM are bottom-up models that simulate the interactions of individual agents using rules and algorithms- Trust is a complex and multidimensional concept that involves moral, social, psychological, and rational aspects.
